Hi! I'm Hannah, an undergraduate student at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science. I'm pursuing minors in Finance and Statistics and Machine Learning. Right now, Iâ€™m particularly interested in machine learning and data science. I'm graduating in May 2027 and am looking for internship roles.

Feel free to reach out at hc8499@princeton.edu!
